**INForcast** will help you forcast your next Influenza vaccine order. Never order too much vaccine again.

This [Streamlit app](https://project-inforcast-vefgcxaqwutphk3vfkfgkq.streamlit.app/) will help you analyse and forcast your influenza vaccine needs. Leveraging advanced TimeSeries modeling, the app delves into historical vaccination records and seasonal patterns, offering you a tailored prediction for your future Influenza vaccine requirements.  
Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis of your current yearâ€™s vaccination statistics against the data from previous years, giving you a clearer picture of trends and changes. Use our trained model to forcast your vaccination requirement, or train the model with your own data.
